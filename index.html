        <h1>The Philippines in the 19th Century</h1>
        <p>Context of José Rizal</p>
    </div>

    <div class="container">

        <div class="section">
            <p>José Rizal was born in the 19th century, a time of major global transformation. The Industrial Revolution changed how people worked and lived, replacing manual labor with machines and creating growing cities. Political revolutions in America and France spread new ideas about freedom, equality, and human rights. This was the world José Rizal was born into in 1861, a world caught between old traditions and new possibilities.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Economic and Social Transformation in the Philippines</h2>
            <p>Before the Spanish came, Filipinos traded freely with neighboring countries such as China, Japan, Siam, Cambodia, India, Borneo, and the Moluccas. But Spain monopolized Manila's ports, creating the Galleon Trade also known as Manila-Acapulco Trade. In 1813, this system ended and Spain opened the Philippines to world commerce in 1834, turning the country into a supplier of raw materials for Western industries. When the Suez Canal opened in 1869, the journey between Europe and the Philippines became much shorter, allowing liberal ideas to flow in and wealthy Filipino families to send their sons to study in Europe. This created the ilustrado class, educated Filipinos who would lead the reform movement.</p>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Rise of Wealthy Filipino Families</h2>
            <p>The new cash-crop economy created a Filipino middle class. The Inquilino system allowed wealthy Filipinos to lease large estates from friars and profit from sugar, tobacco, and abaca production. Rizal's own family, the Mercados, became prosperous landowners in Laguna. This wealth gave them the means to educate their children well. But economic growth also widened the gap between rich and poor, sparking revolts like the Basi Revolt in Ilocos. </p>

        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Conditions Under Spanish Rule</h2>
            <p>Despite all this economic progress, Spanish colonial rule remained harsh and unfair. Friars and Spanish officials controlled everything: politics, education, and the economy. They treated brown-skinned Filipinos as inferior, childlike, and incapable of self-government. Justice was expensive, slow, and biased. When harsh Governor-General Izquierdo took power, his brutal policies led to the Cavite Mutiny of 1872 and the execution of three Filipino priests, Gomez, Burgos, and Zamora (GomBurZa). These executions deeply affected the young Rizal and fueled the nationalist movement.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Educational Reform</h2>
            <p>The Industrial Revolution led to the need for changes in the Philippine education system so that it could focus on preparing skilled workers who could meet economic demands.</p>
            <p>To address the shortage of formal education for Filipinos, the Spanish colonial government implemented the Educational Decree of 1863. This law required the creation of a nationwide public school system, mandating at least one primary school for boys and girls in every town. It marked the beginning of a more organized public education system and increased access to schooling for many Filipinos. Despite this, reports indicated that the poor condition of education in places like Pangasinan was not mainly because teachers were underpaid, but because there were too few teachers compared to the number of students. Whether a town had 250 or even 1,000 pupils, there were typically only one male and one female teacher assigned.</p>

        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Europe's Crisis and Rizal's Education</h2>
            <p>Europe in the 1800s was going through an identity crisis. Industrialization made life feel mechanical and cold. Darwin's theory challenged the idea that humans were special creations. Different philosophies like Marxism, positivism, and romanticism competed for followers. Rizal, as an ilustrado studying in Europe, absorbed liberal ideas about equality and freedom. But he noticed something troubling, Europeans preached equality at home while treating their colonies and colonized people as inferior. This contradiction pushed Rizal to develop his own philosophy, one rooted in Filipino experience rather than blindly copying European thought.</p>
            <div class="note"><img src="img/Books, Ideas, and Awakening.jpg" alt="Photo of ilustrados in formal European clothing"></div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Ideas and Awakening</h2>
            <p>The Ateneo Municipal de Manila influenced Filipino nationalism by shaping the intellectual, emotional, and patriotic development of José Rizal, who said his education there transformed him through discipline, study, and Jesuit guidance, while also strengthening his patriotic feelings and awareness. Although the school did not intend to teach nationalism, its humanistic training emphasized justice and human dignity, giving Rizal a foundation that later deepened when the Philippines opened to world trade and foreign ideas entered through books and printed materials. Through this exposure, Rizal encountered Enlightenment thinkers such as John Locke and Jean‑Jacques Rousseau, as well as European literary works like The Count of Monte Cristo and The Three Musketeers by Alexandre Dumas, which exposed him to themes of justice, freedom, and resistance. Seeing the contradiction between Spain’s liberal ideals and its actual treatment of Filipinos ultimately shaped his decision to pursue reform through writing rather than violence.</p>
            <div class="note"><img src="img/ateneo.jpg" alt="Ateneo"></div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Fighting with the Pen</h2>
            <p>Through his novels Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo, Rizal exposed the cruelty and hypocrisy of Spanish rule. He challenged racist claims that Filipinos were weak or uncivilized, arguing that Filipino suffering came from colonial abuse, not racial inferiority. He proved through his writing that Filipinos were capable of reason, dignity, and greatness. His work helped create the Propaganda Movement, a group of Filipino students abroad who advocated for peaceful reforms.</p>
            <div class="note"><img src="img/Fighting with the Pen.png" alt="Rizal Writing"></div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Legacy</h2>
            <p>Rizal founded La Liga Filipina in 1892, promoting unity and peaceful reform among Filipinos. But the Spanish saw him as dangerous. In 1896, they executed him by firing squad. Rizal went to his death with dignity, uncertain whether his sacrifice would succeed but committed to the cause anyway. His execution didn't end the movement, it ignited it. The Philippine Revolution followed, inspired by the ideas and courage of a man who fought with words instead of weapon.</p>
            <p>The 19th century gave birth to modern Filipino nationalism, and José Rizal was its voice. The economic changes, educational opportunities, and exposure to liberal ideas awakened Filipinos to their own dignity and potential. Rizal transformed that awakening into a movement that would change Philippine history forever.</p>
